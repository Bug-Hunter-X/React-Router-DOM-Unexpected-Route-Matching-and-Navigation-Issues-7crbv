# React Router DOM Unexpected Route Matching and Navigation Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using React Router DOM: unexpected route matching and navigation problems.  The bug involves improper handling of route parameters and nested routes leading to incorrect page rendering or navigation failures.

## Bug Description:

The application uses React Router DOM to manage navigation. However, under certain conditions, routes are not matched correctly, resulting in unexpected behavior.  This might manifest as:

* Incorrect components being rendered for specific paths.
* Navigation failuresâ€”clicking a link doesn't change the displayed component.
* Errors related to route parameters or nested routes.

## Solution:

The solution addresses this issue by carefully reviewing and adjusting the route definitions within React Router's `Routes` component. This involves ensuring correct usage of route parameters and proper nesting of routes. 

## How to Reproduce the Bug:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `bug` directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Observe the incorrect route matching behavior.

## How to Test the Solution:

1. Navigate to the `solution` directory.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Verify that route matching and navigation work as expected.
